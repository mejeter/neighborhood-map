# Neighborhood Map

### Source code for a single page map application.
This program displays a map of Chicago, IL and lists popular destinations in the downtown area in a toggled dropdown menu.

This program utilizes:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Knockout
* jQuery
* Google Maps API
* Foursquare API

The `main.js` file has the functionality for the map, as well as the map markers, and calls the API key. The `data.js` file contains the coordinates for the selected locations. The `knockout.js` file binds HTML elements to JavaScript functions. The `index.html` file calls the functions and scripts and `styles.css` provides the styling.
